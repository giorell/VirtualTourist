# OnTheMap

This is my second project for the 2nd semester of the Udacity iOS program. 

The goal of the app for a user to place a map pin and to click on the pin. Once the pin is clicked, the view transitions to a collection view with images. The images can be deleted and rearranged. 

Previews made from iPhone X. 

The app contains the following view controllers:

1. Map Page
2. Collection View Page

#### MAP PAGE
On the map page, the user holds a finger on the screen to create a pin. To delete the pin, the user has to hold onto the pin until it deletes. The pin's location is saved to CoreData.

#### COLLECTION VIEW PAGE
The homepage shows all of the pins that were added by students. Each pin is clickable and takes you to the provided URL link.
